Both MiniTest and Rspec are available, and it includes haml. Feel free to use any library you want.

# How to Prepare
In the pairing session you will be building a Rails app to solve a simple problem. We will be looking for familiarity with database schema design, Rails routes, MVC best practices, Rails forms, Javascript, and XHRs.
